Today, my goal is to research networking to learn more about what I can do for my project.
I did some research in networking using java for my project. Tomorrow, I need to do a little bit more research and get started with coding.

Today, I learned some more about sockets and how they work in two way communication and networking. I updated the presentation with the new information I found.
Tomorrow, I will research endpoints and echoes and their function in communication  between two programs. I will use this to add to the presentation.
